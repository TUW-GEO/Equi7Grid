# Equi7Grid
Definition of the Equi7Grid - a spatial reference optimized for global high-resolution raster data.

See an overview presentation here: https://github.com/TUW-GEO/Equi7Grid/blob/develope_package/documentation/EuroCarto2015_BBM_Equi7Grid.pdf

The branch "develop_package" is most advanced (June 2016), as this contains the preparations for the full publication of the Equi7 Grid.

May 2017: The branch "new_grid_env" features an updated module called TiledProjectionSystem. It is work-in-progress and a general interface for systems like e.g. Equi7Grid or MGRS.

Please check version of your GDAL and proj.4 packages/bindings. Only proj.4 >= 4.9.2 is accurate!
