# Home view

When you launch the Equi7Grid webviewer, the screen will look like this:

![home](images/homeview.png)

The header contains several links:
On the left side you have two logos/links to the creators of the Webviewer and the Equi7Grid itself. On the right side there is a link to the GitHub repo (<img src="images/github_logo.png" width="20" style="margin-bottom: -5px; margin-right: -2px;">), to the Equi7Grid documentation (📖), and to GitHub issues to report problems or to request new features (📬).

The map itself displays OpenStreetMap in the background and interactions with the map are intuitive, including zoom buttons in the top-right corner. In the lower-left corner you can see a globe. If you click on it, your map will start to render as a globe in 3D.

:::{note}
The 3D view only works in Chrome.

The globe changed to a map icon. If you click on it again, you will get back to the 2D map view.

On the left you have a menu of tools you can use to interact with the map and displayed items:

- [Add tiling](./tiling.md) (➕)
- [Coordinate transformations](./tiling.md) (📐)
- [Layer manager](./tiling.md) (📚)
- [Tile query](./tiling.md) (🔍)
- [Display settings](./tiling.md) (🔩)
