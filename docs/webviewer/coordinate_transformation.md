# Coordinate transformer

The coordinate transformer provides an interface to a coordinate tuple in any projected reference system to the Equi7Grid and vice versa.

A nice feature is that you can directly use the map coordinates and autofill them into the form via a right click on the map. To do so, you need to toggle the _Use map coordinates_ checkbox. As long as this checkbox is ticked, the _CRS_ box is deactivate and set to the LonLat system (4326).
