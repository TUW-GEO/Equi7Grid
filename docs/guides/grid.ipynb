    "At the top of the Equi7Grid entities is the grid itself, which is a collection of tiling systems sharing a tiling concept, but differ in their projection (however, the projection should be from the same family). The Equi7Grid for instance is a collection of seven continental equidistant azimuthal projections. Another example would be the UTM projection with 60 cylindrical projections for 6 degree steps around the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard realisation of the Equi7Grid has seven continental tiling schemes: Africa (\"AF\"), Antarctica (\"AN\"), Asia (\"AS\"), Europe (\"EU\"), North America (\"NA\"), Oceania (\"OC\"), and South America (\"SA\"). Each continent is a consistent tiling system with three tiling levels by default: T1 (100km tile size), T3 (300km tile size), and T6 (600km tile size).\n",

    "The `equi7grid` projection provides four user-facing functions to create an `Equi7Grid` object: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_standard_equi7grid`: returns the standard Equi7Grid as defined above\n",
    "- `get_user_equi7grid`: returns a user-defined version of the Equi7Grid to allow for other tilings \n",
    "- `get_equi7grid_from_grid_def`: returns an Equi7Grid instance based on a grid definition in a JSON file (can be used to share a specific definition with other people)\n",
    "- `get_equi7grid_from_file`: returns an Equi7Grid instance based on an instance definition in a JSON file, i.e., everything is set in stone, e.g. the sampling cannot be changed anymore (can be used to share a specific instance with other people)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a look at the first two methods, which do not have require any additional files. One important argument for these functions is the `sampling`, which can be specified in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sampling=500`: all tiling levels will use a sampling of 500m.\n",
    "- `sampling={\"T6\": 500, \"T3\": 20, \"T1\": 10}`: each tiling level has a specific sampling\n",
    "- `sampling={\"T3\": 40}`: there is only one tiling level with the specified sampling, all others will be discarded\n",

    "There are two optional arguments: `buffered` and `continent_order`. `buffered` is a boolean flag (defaults to false) defining if a buffered version of the projection zones should be used or not. These special versions of the projection zones have a 100km buffer over land to be able to fully represent certain countries in one projection/tiling system. Note that this means that a global coordinate, e.g. a longitude latitude coordinate, might intersect with multiple projection zones. As an example, when reprojecting a geographic coordinate to the Equi7Grid, multiple Equi7Grid coordinates might be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why there is a second argument `continent_order` to be able to control the order of the returned coordinates or tiling systems. `continent_order` is a list of Equi7Grid continent identifiers specifying the desired order of the returned values and does not need to be complete. If a subset is specified, then other continents are not touched or returned allowing to speed up initialisation and queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to create an Equi7Grid instance is with `get_user_equi7grid`. This method provides more flexibility in terms of introducing a user-specific tiling scheme, e.g. \"T2\" with a tile size of 200km. For this we need the `RegularTilingDefinition` class from `pytileproj` and the desired tile size/shape associated with the tiling ID/name. The tiling definition is then specified as a dictionary with the tiling levels as keys and the `RegularTilingDefinition` instances as values."
